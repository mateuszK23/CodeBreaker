# CodeBreaker
This is a program that allows user to encode or decode anything in 3 types of ciphers:
Caesar Cipher, Keyed Caesar Cipher as well as Vigenere Cipher.

The defaults folder contains starting key values for ciphers.
Root folder contains a bunch of example text files with encrypted 'Hello World' message, and plainText ( just 'Hello World' ).
To use your own file put it in the root folder(CodeBreaker) alongside src, defaults etc.

To run the program, extract contents of Release.zip file, and use a command 'java -jar CodeBreaker.jar' on the cmd from the Release directory. 

Do not delete text files, otherwise it won't work.

I have included .idea file to make opening as project in Intelij easy.

This project is one of my university assignments, module's coordinator is Chris Loftus from Aberystwyth University.
